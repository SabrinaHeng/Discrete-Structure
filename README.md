  <summary><b>Course Introduction</b></summary>
  <p>This course provides students with an introduction to discrete structures and their applications in computer science. Topics covered include set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. By course completion, students will have developed the skills to utilize set theory, relations, and functions for solving computer science problems. They will also be able to analyze and resolve problems with recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees to real-world situations, and use deterministic finite automata and finite state machines to model electronic devices and other problems.</p>
